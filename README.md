# MyReads Project

For the final assessment project of Udacity's React Fundamentals course,  I made this starter template."To save your time" is the main objective of this template. This can be done by providing  a static example of the CSS and HTML markup.If you need to start with this template, you have to refactor the static code in this template to add interactivity to the app.

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## How to run the project in Development Mode
The project uses [Node.js >= 6.x](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [Create-React-App starter code](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

After Node is installed in your system, follow the below steps.

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the app.
2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/manishbisht/Neighborhood-Map-React.git`
3. Now install all modules listed as dependencies in `package.json` by running the command `npm install`
4. Launch the app with this command `npm start`

A new browser window open automatically displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
